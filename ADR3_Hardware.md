Decision Title:
Selecting Hardware for a Simple Game App

Status:
Accepted

Context: 
Our team needs to select appropriate hardware components for the simple game app. We want to ensure a smooth and enjoyable user experience while keeping the hardware requirements minimal. It is worth noting that the majority of modern smartphones come equipped with all the necessary hardware components to run our simple game app effectively.
Option Considered:
	Touchscreen
	Speaker
	Vibrator Motor
	Bluetooth
	Accelerometer/Gyroscope

Decision:
After evaluating various hardware options, our team has determined that our game’s requirements necessitate the following components: touchscreen, speakers, vibration motor, and Bluetooth. These components have been carefully chosen to meet our app’s functionality and enhance the overall user experience.

Rationale:
As we examine all possible components needed for our application. We came across some must-have choices such as touchscreen and speakers. With more thought, we also opted in for some optional features that could enhance our user experience such as vibration motor and Bluetooth.
- Touchscreen:
Touchscreen functionally is essential for users to interact with game elements, make selections, and play games effectively. All modern smartphones come with touchscreen, providing the primary input method for user interactions. 

- Speakers:
The speaker is crucial for providing game sounds, feedback, and background music. Sound effects for card flips in the memory game and victory sounds in tic-tac-toe can enhance the gaming experience significantly.

- Vibration Motor:
Vibration feedback can enhance the gaming experience, providing tactile feedback for actions such as card flips in the memory game or confirming moves in tic-tac-toe. It is optional, but when implemented, it contributes to a more immersive gameplay experience.

- Bluetooth:
Bluetooth functionally can be utilized for optional features, such as multiplayer mode where players can connect their devices to play against each other. While this feature enhances the gameplay, it is not a core requirement and is considered optional for users who want a more interactive experience. Bluetooth can also substitute for the smartphone’s speaker by connecting a wireless device.

Consequences:
By selecting touchscreen, speakers, vibration motor, and Bluetooth as the hardware components. Our team can anticipate the following consequences. Development complexity could be an issue, adding in Bluetooth implementation could make the development process harder. Added in vibration requires careful consideration and testing to ensure that it is not overwhelming or confusing to the user. Both these features could result in taking more resources from our team, but we are hopeful that it will add to the user enjoyment to create a more immersive experience.
